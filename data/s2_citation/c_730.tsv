S1viikbCW	2018	Reject	False	TCAV: Relative concept importance testing with Linear Concept Activation Vectors	"[""Been Kim"", ""Justin Gilmer"", ""Martin Wattenberg"", ""Fernanda Vi\u00e9gas""]"	[]	This work aims to provide quantitative answers to the relative importance of concepts of interest via concept activation vectors (CAV). In particular, this framework enables non-machine learning experts to express concepts of interest and test hypotheses using examples (e.g., a set of pictures that illustrate  the concept). We show that CAV can be learned given a relatively small set of examples. Hypothesis testing with CAV can answer whether a particular concept (e.g., gender) is more important in predicting a given class (e.g., doctor) than other sets of concepts. Interpreting networks with CAV does not require any retraining or modification of the network. 					5263339	2018.0	2018-02-15	36
